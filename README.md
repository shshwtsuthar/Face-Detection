# Face-Detection
Face detection is a problem in computer vision of locating and localizing one or more faces in a photograph.

# OpenCV
OpenCV comes with a number of built-in cascades for detecting everything from faces to eyes to hands to legs. There are even cascades for non-human things. For example, if you run a banana shop and want to track people stealing bananas, this guy has built one for that!

# Cascades 
The cascades themselves are just a bunch of XML files that contain OpenCV data used to detect objects. You initialize your code with the cascade.
